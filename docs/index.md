This is the place for all my experiments. I thrive by keeping myself busy and trying new technologies. Base on the title, you are correct to assume that I'm a SRE for my 9-5 weekday time. The remainder of my time I try to entertain myself with a variety of other subjects. I do tend to try a lot of SRE/DevOps technologies (sorry not sorry) but I'll make sure to bring in some other valuable experiments in here.

Some of the SRE/DevOps experiments you can expect here:

- Cloud Computing
- Security
- Kubernetes
- GitOps
- Continuous Integration


Now for my other experiments:

- Programming language development
- Testing frameworks
- Raspberry setups
- Home automation DIY
- Databases 
- Kafka/Redis/RabbitMQ
- Productivity hacks
- Conferences/Certifications/Courses

A little bit about myself:

As stated before, I'm an SRE and I have a Software Engineering bachelor degree. I'll try to make myself as anonymous as possible - my ultimate goal is to have you here to read about the experiments and start a conversation about it and that we can all learn something more from it.
